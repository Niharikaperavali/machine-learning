# üß† ML - Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!

This repo contains projects and hands-on implementations of various **ML algorithms**. All projects are done using **Google Colab**, with a focus on learning and experimenting with core machine learning concepts.


You don‚Äôt need to memorize every line of ML code.
You should focus on understanding the core concepts, workflow, and how/when to use the right methods.
üîÅ Typical ML Workflow You Should Know Well:

1.Import libraries

2.Load and explore the data

3.Preprocess the data (cleaning, encoding, scaling, etc.)

4.Split data into train/test

5.Choose an algorithm (Linear Regression, SVM, etc.)

6.Train the model

7.Predict using the model

8.Evaluate performance

9.Visualize results (optional but helpful)
